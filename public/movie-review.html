<h3>The Menu</h3>
★★★★★
<p>
  This movie was so tense! I loved it. It might start off slow, but every new
  course cranks up the heat, culminating in a fiery finale that has to be seen
  to be believed!
</p>
<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
★★★☆☆
<p>
  I had low hopes for this one, but it ended up being a really enjoyable ride!
  The actors were all charming, and I loved how all the different stories came
  together by the end.

<h3>Avatar 2: The Way of Water</h3>
★★★★☆
<p>
  What can I say about this one that hasn't already been said? The plot may not
  have been anything revolutionary, but the film had a solid emotional core that
  drew me in, and the visuals were stunning! I saw it in 3D, and it really felt
  like I was being transported to another world.
