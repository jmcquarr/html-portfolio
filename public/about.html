<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a former Assistant Language Teacher living in Marugame, Japan. I love my
  wonderful wife, my two cats, and bold, black coffee!

<h2>My Skills</h2>
<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>
  I've always been fascinated by what makes all the weird and wonderful websites
  on the Internet tick, so one day I sat down and decided to learn how to make
  them myself!
</p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>
  Cooking is my passion! I love making the Tex-Mex and Southern soul food I grew
  up on, and finding creative ways to fuse it with Japanese techniques and
  traditional cuisine.
